/*Primality Test
For a given number N check if it is prime or not. A prime number is a number which is only divisible by 1 and itself.

Input:
First line contains an integer, the number of test cases 'T'. T testcases follow. Each test case should contain a positive integer N.

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, print "Yes" if it is a prime number else print "No".

Your Task:
This is a function problem. You just need to complete the function isPrime that takes N as parameter and returns True if N is prime else returns false. The printing is done automatically by the driver code.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 103

Example:
Input:
2
5
4
Output:
Yes
No

Explanation:
Testcase 1: 5 is the prime number as it is divisible only by 1 and 5.
Testcase 2: 4 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 1 2 and 4.
